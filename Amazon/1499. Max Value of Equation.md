/*
the equation given is yi + yj + |xi - xj|. As the x values are sorted, therefore the 
equation can be written as

(yi + yj) + (xj - xi) as i < j, thus xi < xj. Deriving the equation removes the modulo 
function which is slow to calculate

(xj + yj) + (yi - xi)

in DQ we store the values in decreasing order of (yi - xi)
