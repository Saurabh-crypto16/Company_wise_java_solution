/*
You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. 
The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.
We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, 
which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. 
Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.
